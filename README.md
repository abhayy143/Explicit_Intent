# Explicit_Intent
Hello, folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

The primitive work of the application is that it takes the user input and travels with the data to a new activity and displays it right there.  

Do you know how it all happened? 🤔

Yes, you're right! 🤩

We used the explicit intent but what exactly it is let's know it below.

Explicit Intent:- It communicates between two activities inside the same application.🤝
